# in-out-temperature
This is an Arduino implementation on the esp8266 NodeMCU development board that measures temperature with the DBS18B20 sensor and reports it through the ubidots sensor cloud service. To use this software copy the config-sample.h as config.h and edit. You must provide your wifi SSID, wifi password and ubidots API key which you get after registering. Then compile and upload the code to the esp8266 using the Arduino developemnt environment.
